# Follow Up on PR CI and Reviews

Use this workflow after you create a PR or push to an open PR.

## Monitor checks

```bash
PR_NUMBER=${PR_NUMBER:-$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)}
gh pr checks "$PR_NUMBER" --watch
```

When the checks stop, inspect their status:

```bash
gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json url,statusCheckRollup,comments,reviews,reviewDecision
```

## Review feedback

Check PR comments and inline review comments from CodeRabbit and the PR Review Advisor:

```bash
gh api "repos/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/issues/${PR_NUMBER}/comments" --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | select((.body // "") | test("CodeRabbit|coderabbit|PR Review Advisor|nemoclaw-pr-review-advisor"; "i")) | {author: .user.login, updated_at, body}'

gh api "repos/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/comments" --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | select((.body // "") | test("CodeRabbit|coderabbit|PR Review Advisor|nemoclaw-pr-review-advisor"; "i")) | {author: .user.login, path, line, updated_at, body}'
```

## Handle results

- Apply [NemoClaw Technical English](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md#nemoclaw-technical-english) to review comments and proposed rewrites.
- During the changed-text pilot, block on language only when ambiguity can change behavior, security, data safety, test meaning, or release meaning.
- Treat other language findings as suggestions. Include a proposed rewrite and do not request unrelated cleanup.
- Before you act on feedback, state the problem and the intended result.
- Do not add a helper, configuration switch, fallback, migration, or compatibility path only to satisfy reviewer wording.
- Treat feedback as a suggestion if you cannot connect it to one of these conditions:
  - A defect.
  - A demonstrated security or data-safety risk.
  - A supported contract.
  - Unnecessary complexity in changed code.
  - Ambiguity in changed text that can change behavior, security, data safety, test meaning, or release meaning.
- **CI failure:** Inspect the job logs and fix the cause. Run the related local checks. Commit, push, and monitor the PR again.
- **Valid CodeRabbit or PR Review Advisor finding:** Fix correctness, security, or test-coverage problems. Run the related checks. Commit, push, and monitor the PR again.
- **Style comment or false positive:** Avoid unnecessary changes. Explain your decision in the final report. Comment on the PR when reviewers need the explanation.
- **Ambiguous, risky, broad, or design-changing feedback:** Stop and ask the user before you change code.

Repeat this workflow until required CI passes and no actionable automated-review findings remain. Stop if the user tells you to stop.

If a push or GitHub query has an access error, follow [Git and GitHub Access Hard Stop](git-github-hard-stop.md).
Resolve merge conflicts and dirty-worktree problems in the PR workflow.
Ask the user when a resolution can change behavior or contributor intent.
