# Contributing to NemoClaw Documentation

This guide covers how to write, edit, and review documentation for NemoClaw. If you change code that affects user-facing behavior, update the relevant docs in the same PR.

## When to Update Docs

Update documentation when your change:

- Adds, removes, or renames a CLI command or flag.
- Changes default behavior or configuration.
- Adds a new feature that users interact with.
- Fixes a bug that the docs describe incorrectly.
- Changes an API, protocol, or policy schema.

## Confirm Product Scope Before Writing Docs

Canonical documentation describes behavior that NemoClaw has chosen to support and maintain.
A documentation PR must not establish a new supported integration, solution workflow, custom image, third-party stack, or product surface by itself.

Technical correctness, successful builds, and working examples are necessary evidence, but they are not product approval.
Before documenting a new surface, confirm that an accepted issue or design decision defines ownership, compatibility and upgrade expectations, security review, lifecycle support, and validation.

Route independent solutions, complete use-case examples, and third-party integrations through [Community Solutions](resources/community-contributions.mdx).
If the correct destination is unclear, request maintainer direction before drafting the page.

## Update and Refactor Docs with Agent Skills

If you use an AI coding agent (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, etc.), the repo includes the `nemoclaw-contributor-update-docs` skill that automates doc work.
Use it before writing from scratch.

The skill scans recent commits for user-facing changes and drafts doc updates.
Run it after landing features, before a release, or to find doc gaps.
For example, ask your agent to "catch up the docs for the changes I made in this PR".
During release prep, run the skill first, make any doc version bumps, then open the docs refresh PR.

The skill lives in `.agents/skills/nemoclaw-contributor-update-docs/` and follows the style guide below automatically.

Use the maintainer-owned `nemoclaw-maintainer-refactor-docs` skill when a page or section has grown too large, mixes several user tasks, or needs a nested TOC.
Use it to inventory the existing content, organize topics around the user journey, keep foldable navigation groups non-clickable, assign one canonical owner per topic, and preserve Fern routes, redirects, and agent variants during the split.
Find the skill in `.agents/skills/nemoclaw-maintainer-refactor-docs/`.

## Markdown Docs for AI Agents

The `docs/` directory is the source of truth for user-facing documentation.
NemoClaw publishes Markdown versions of Fern pages plus `llms.txt`, so AI agents can fetch canonical documentation directly.

The hand-written `nemoclaw-user-guide` skill only routes agents to the right Markdown docs.
It must stay small and must not copy page content from `docs/`.

Always make user-facing doc updates in `docs/`.
Update `docs/resources/agent-skills.mdx` and `.agents/skills/nemoclaw-user-guide/SKILL.md` only when the AI-agent routing guidance changes.

## Building Docs Locally

Verify the docs are built correctly by building them and checking the output.

The public site is built with Fern.
The repo pins the Fern CLI version in `fern/fern.config.json`.
Use the npm scripts so every docs command uses that pinned version.

To print the pinned Fern CLI version, run:

```bash
npm run docs:deps
```

To validate the Fern configuration and MDX pages, run:

```bash
npm run docs
```

To serve the docs locally and automatically rebuild on changes, run:

```bash
npm run docs:live
```

To publish a branch-based Fern preview whenever docs files change, run:

```bash
npm run docs:preview:watch
```

The preview watcher uses the current Git branch name as the Fern preview ID and watches the `docs/` and `fern/` directories.
By default, it publishes to the `nvidia-nemoclaw-staging.docs.buildwithfern.com/nemoclaw` Fern docs instance.
Set `FERN_STAGING_INSTANCE` to a `<hostname>/<path>` value when you need to target a different Fern docs instance.
The watcher rejects blank or malformed overrides before it starts Fern.

Fern `.mdx` pages are the canonical docs source.
Fern publishes Markdown routes for AI agents from the same source pages.

## Updating the Changelog

The native Fern changelog under `docs/changelog/` is the canonical release history.
One source directory is shared across the OpenClaw, Hermes, and Deep Agents user-guide variants.
Create the planned release entry in the pre-tag release-note docs PR so it lands on `main` before the release plan captures the tag commit.

For each release:

- Add the complete release entry to `docs/changelog/YYYY-MM-DD.mdx`, using the release date as the filename.
- Start the entry with an H2 version heading such as `## v0.0.83`.
- If more than one release ships on the same date, put each version in the same file with the newest version first.
- Include the summary and detailed bullets in the dated file; do not create separate variant-specific Release Notes pages.
- Use literal CLI names instead of the `$$nemoclaw` variant placeholder because native changelog files do not pass through agent-variant generation.
- Use root-absolute published routes for internal links in dated entries.
  Generic links should target the OpenClaw route under `/user-guide/openclaw/`; agent-specific links should target the corresponding Hermes or Deep Agents route.
- Use MDX comment syntax (`{/* ... */}`) for the SPDX header; HTML comments do not parse in Fern changelog entries.
- Keep every dated entry directly under `docs/changelog/`; Fern does not support subdirectories there.

## Publishing Docs

GitHub Actions publishes Fern docs from the same source files that `npm run docs` validates locally.

Docs PRs get Fern previews when they change `docs/`, `fern/`, or docs build inputs.
The preview workflow publishes to the staging Fern instance with a `pr-<number>` preview ID and posts the preview URL on the PR when `FERN_TOKEN` is available.

After a docs PR merges, pushes to `main` publish the affected docs to the staging Fern instance.
The staging publish job regenerates agent variants, validates Fern docs, publishes staging, and deletes the merged PR preview when it can map the merge commit back to a PR.

Public docs publish automatically when a `v*.*.*` release tag is pushed.
The public publish job runs in the `docs-public` environment, verifies that the tag commit is reachable from `origin/main`, regenerates agent variants, validates Fern docs, and publishes to the public Fern instance.
If the tag does not point to a commit on `main`, the job stops before installing dependencies or running Fern.

## Starter Prompt Generation

The canonical coding-agent installation prompt lives in `docs/resources/starter-prompt.md`.
Edit that Markdown file instead of placing prompt text in a React component.
Keep conditional platform instructions in focused Markdown files under `docs/resources/prompt-assets/` and link to their raw GitHub URLs from the starter prompt.
The main prompt should tell the coding agent when to load each asset and should not repeat the asset's detailed instructions.
Use one shared immutable commit SHA for every platform-asset URL in a starter-prompt revision.
The contributor who changes any platform asset owns the corresponding pin update.
First commit the updated assets, starter-prompt behavior, and related tests without changing the existing URLs, `promptAssetRevision`, or pinned SHA-256 values.
Then use that commit's SHA in every platform-asset URL, update `promptAssetRevision` and every pinned SHA-256 value in `test/starter-prompt-docs.test.ts`, and commit the repin as one atomic follow-up.
Never mix asset URLs from different revisions or point an asset URL at a commit that predates its content.
The asset test compares each local file byte-for-byte with its Git blob at `promptAssetRevision`, so the intermediate content commit intentionally fails until the atomic repin follow-up points every URL, revision, and digest at that content commit.
Updating only a local digest does not prove what the pinned revision contains.
Downstream consumers can pin the source with a raw URL such as
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/<commit-sha>/docs/resources/starter-prompt.md`.
The Markdown SPDX comment is part of that raw file but does not appear when Markdown is rendered.

The `scripts/generate-starter-prompt.mts` script removes the Markdown SPDX preamble and writes `docs/_build/StarterPrompt.generated.mdx`.
The generated snippet wraps the prompt in Fern's native visible `Prompt` component, which displays the prompt body and supplies the copy button.
The generated file is ignored by Git and is recreated by the docs build.

Run the generator directly when you need to inspect the generated snippet:

```bash
npm run docs:sync-starter-prompt
```

Run the read-only comparison after generation when you need to verify that the snippet matches the Markdown source:

```bash
npm run docs:check-starter-prompt
```

The shared `npm run docs:prepare` step generates the Starter Prompt and agent variants.
The normal `npm run docs`, `npm run docs:live`, agent-variant sync, preview-watcher, and docs publish workflows run that step before Fern validates, serves, previews, or publishes the pages that include the prompt.

## Agent Variant Generation

Some Fern pages appear in the OpenClaw, Hermes, and Deep Agents guide variants.
The `scripts/sync-agent-variant-docs.mts` script reads `docs/index.yml` and renders variant-specific copies for every page that appears in multiple guide variants before Fern validates or publishes the site.
The source pages stay in their normal `docs/` locations, and generated pages are written under `docs/_build/agent-variants/`, which is ignored by Git.
Navigation in `docs/index.yml` points Fern at generated pages for shared entries so Fern still renders normal fenced code blocks with copy buttons and syntax highlighting.
OpenClaw-only, Hermes-only, or Deep Agents-only pages stay as source pages in navigation.

When shared page content is the same except for the host CLI binary, write one source page and use `$$nemoclaw` as a build-time placeholder.
Do not duplicate fenced code blocks or inline command examples only to switch between `nemoclaw` and `nemohermes`.
Use literal command names on those single-variant pages rather than `$$nemoclaw`, because no generated page will rewrite the placeholder.

Run `npm run docs:sync-agent-variants` after editing shared variant source pages or navigation.
Run `npm run docs` before opening a PR to verify the generated pages, rewritten relative links, and Fern navigation.
If content differs by behavior, setup flow, state layout, or agent-specific wording, keep using `<AgentOnly>` blocks for that content.
Treat `<AgentOnly>` as a build-time directive rather than a React component, and do not import it from `AgentGuide.tsx`.
Put each opening and closing tag at the first column on its own line, and do not nest the blocks.
The generated pages must contain only statically resolved content, with no `AgentGuide` imports or runtime agent components.

## Route-Style Links

Fern links between docs pages should use route-style paths, not filesystem paths.
Route-style paths omit the `.mdx` extension and follow the page slugs declared in `docs/index.yml`.
For example, a source page under `docs/get-started/` should link to the OpenClaw quickstart as `../quickstart`, not `quickstart.mdx`.
The published route comes from the navigation hierarchy and page `slug`, not directly from the file path.

This matters for generated agent variants because shared source pages may not appear directly in `docs/index.yml`.
The navigation can point Fern at generated pages under `docs/_build/agent-variants/`, while the source MDX remains in its normal folder.
The link checker maps those generated nav entries back to their source paths when validating route-style links.
Do not convert route-style links to `.mdx` file links just to satisfy a local filesystem check.

## Doc-Only PR Verification

Doc-only pull requests do not need the full test suite by default.
Commit and push normally so the Git hooks run, then run:

```bash
npm run docs
```

Leave the broad-gate verification item unchecked unless you actually ran the applicable command.
If normal `pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, or `pre-push` hooks were skipped or unavailable, run `npm run check:diff` once to reproduce those checks before opening the PR.
The command uses `origin/main`, so refresh it with `git fetch origin main` first.
Run targeted tests once per relevant change set only when the change also touches code, generated behavior, or runtime behavior; rerun after later edits or hook autofixes that can affect it.
Reserve `npm test` for broad runtime or test-harness changes.
Reserve `npm run check` for repo-wide validation or coverage-baseline changes.

## Writing Conventions

### Format

- Fern pages use MDX with YAML frontmatter. Use a flat `title`, `description`, optional `sidebar-title`, `description-agent`, `keywords`, and `position`.
- Do not duplicate the page title as a body H1 in MDX pages because Fern renders the title from frontmatter.
- Use `description-agent` as a concise routing summary for AI documentation clients and search indexes.
- Include the SPDX license header in MDX frontmatter as comments:

  ```yaml
  ---
  # SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright (c) 2025-2026 NVIDIA CORPORATION & AFFILIATES. All rights reserved.
  # SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
  title: "NemoClaw Page Title"
  description: "One-sentence summary for readers, SEO, and doc search snippets."
  description-agent: "Third-person verb summary for agent routing. Add 'Use when...' with trigger phrases."
  ---
  ```

description-agent: "Third-person verb summary for agent routing. Add 'Use when...' with trigger phrases."
keywords: "primary keyword, secondary keyword phrase"

```

### Page Structure

1. Start MDX pages with a one- or two-sentence introduction stating what the page covers.
2. Organize sections by task or concept, using H2 and H3. Start each section with an introductory sentence that orients the reader.
3. Use Fern components like `<Note>`, `<Tip>`, `<Warning>`, `<Cards>`, and `<Card>` for callouts and landing-page navigation.
4. Add a "Next Steps" or "Related Topics" section at the bottom when it helps users continue.

## Style Guide

Write like you are explaining something to a colleague. Be direct, specific, and concise.
Apply the [NemoClaw Technical English profile](../CONTRIBUTING.md#nemoclaw-technical-english) to changed prose.
The profile defines shared terminology, sentence rules, rewrite examples, and the changed-text pilot.
The rules below add documentation-specific voice, formatting, and product-name conventions.

### Voice and Tone

- Use active voice. "The CLI creates a gateway" not "A gateway is created by the CLI."
- Use second person ("you") when addressing the reader.
- Use present tense. "The command returns an error" not "The command will return an error."
- State facts. Do not hedge with "simply," "just," "easily," or "of course."

### Things to Avoid

The following patterns are common in LLM-generated text and erode trust with technical readers.
Remove them during review.

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Unnecessary bold | "This is a **critical** step" on routine instructions. | Reserve bold for UI labels, parameter names, and genuine warnings. |
| Em dashes | "The gateway, which runs in Docker, creates sandboxes." | Do not use em dashes. Prefer commas, colons, or separate sentences. |
| Superlatives | "OpenShell provides a powerful, robust, seamless experience." | Say what it does, not how great it is. |
| Hedge words | "Simply run the command" or "You can easily configure..." | Drop the adverb. "Run the command." |
| Emoji in prose | "Let's get started!" | No emoji in documentation prose. |
| Rhetorical questions | "Want to secure your agents? Look no further!" | State the purpose directly. |

### Formatting Rules

- End every sentence with a period.
- One sentence per line in the source file (makes diffs readable).
- Use `code` formatting for CLI commands, file paths, flags, parameter names, and values.
- Use language-specific code blocks for commands that readers should copy.
  Put only the command text in copyable blocks:

  ```bash
  $$nemoclaw onboard
  ```

- Use `$$nemoclaw` as a build-time placeholder for NemoClaw host CLI command examples in shared variant pages.
  The docs build resolves it to `nemoclaw` for OpenClaw pages, `nemohermes` for Hermes pages, and `nemo-deepagents` for Deep Agents pages before Fern renders code blocks.
  This preserves Fern's native fenced-code UI while keeping one source sample.
- Do not write duplicate `<AgentOnly>` fenced code blocks when the only difference is `nemoclaw` versus `nemohermes`.
  Use `<AgentOnly>` blocks only when the surrounding content differs between the OpenClaw and Hermes variants.

- Use `powershell` for Windows PowerShell commands.
  Use `bash` or `sh` for Linux, macOS, and WSL shell commands.
  Use `bash` for generic copyable shell commands when a single tag is needed.
  Do not use prompt markers such as `$` in copyable command blocks.
  Keep command and output in separate fenced code blocks.
  Introduce output blocks with `Expected output:`.
  For output blocks, use `json` when the output is valid JSON, otherwise use `text`.
  Reserve `console` for rare transcript-style examples that intentionally mix command and output, including prompts or interactive sessions, and label the section as transcript-only so readers do not treat it as copy/paste input.

- Use tables for structured comparisons. Keep tables simple (no nested formatting).
- Use Fern callout components (`<Note>`, `<Tip>`, `<Warning>`) for callouts in MDX pages, not bold text.
- Avoid nested admonitions.
- Do not number section titles. Write "Deploy a Gateway" not "Section 1: Deploy a Gateway" or "Step 3: Verify."
- Do not use colons in titles. Write "Deploy and Manage Gateways" not "Gateways: Deploy and Manage."
- Use colons only to introduce a list. Do not use colons as general-purpose punctuation between clauses.

### Word List

Use these consistently:

| Use | Do not use |
|---|---|
| gateway | Gateway (unless starting a sentence) |
| sandbox | Sandbox (unless starting a sentence) |
| CLI | cli, Cli |
| API key | api key, API Key |
| NVIDIA | Nvidia, nvidia |
| NemoClaw | nemoclaw (in prose), Nemoclaw |
| OpenClaw | openclaw (in prose), Openclaw |
| OpenShell | Open Shell, openShell, Openshell, openshell |
| mTLS | MTLS, mtls |
| YAML | yaml, Yaml |

## Submitting Doc Changes

1. Create a branch following the project convention.
2. Make your changes.
3. Build locally with `npm run docs` and verify the output.
4. Open a PR with `docs:` as the conventional commit type.

```text
docs: update quickstart for new onboard wizard
```

If your doc change accompanies a code change, include both in the same PR and use the code change's commit type:

```text
feat(cli): add policy-add command
```

## Reviewing Doc PRs

When reviewing documentation:

- Confirm that the page documents an approved and maintained NemoClaw product surface.
- Do not approve a new integration or solution solely because its instructions work or its checks pass.
- Route independent third-party solutions to [Community Solutions](resources/community-contributions.mdx) when no product decision establishes core ownership.
- Check that the style guide rules above are followed.
- Watch for LLM-generated patterns (excessive bold, em dashes, filler).
- Verify code examples are accurate and runnable.
- Confirm cross-references and links are not broken.
- Build locally to check rendering.
